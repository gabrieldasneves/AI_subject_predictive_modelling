This document addresses some concepts of predictive modeling to perform an exploratory analysis of glass sample data to then pre-process them. The data set consists of nine predictors. Asymmetry, mean and standard deviation were calculated in order to apply statistical methods to reduce the dimensionality of information and use this dataset to construct a model that predicts accurate results.
